# Create a channel

* `name` _is case sensitive_, is limited to _48 characters_, and may only contain `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, hyphen `-` and underscore `_`.
 Surrounding white space is trimmed (e.g. "  foo  " -> "foo" ).

* `owner` is optional and is limited to 48 characters.

* `ttlDays` and `maxItems` are optional, and only one can have a value greater than zero at a time. If neither is specified, a default value of 120 ttlDays is used.
Please see [channel limits](hub_channels_overview.html#channel-limits) for more details.  To change a channel to ttlDays or maxItems, set the other value explicitly to zero.

* `keepForever` overrides any `ttlDays` and `maxItems` settings.  Data inserted into a channel with keepForever=true will not be deleted.

* `description` is optional and defaults to an empty string.  This text field can be up to 1024 bytes long.

* `tags` is an optional array of string values.  Tag values are limited to 48 characters, and may only contain `a-z`, `A-Z` and `0-9`.
A channel may have at most 20 tags.

* `replicationSource` is the optional fully qualified path to channel in a another hub.  The data from the other channel
will be duplicated into this channel.  Please see [replication](hub_channels_replication.html) for more details.

* `storage` is the optional specification of how to store long term data.  The default is `SINGLE`.  
High volume channels can see significant reductions in S3 costs by using `BATCH`.  
`BOTH` is a way to transition between the two states, and perform comparisons.  More information in [storage](hub_other_channel_storage.html)

* `protect` is the optional setting to prevent changes which might cause some data loss.
Please see [protected channels](hub_channels_protect.html) for more details.

`PUT http://hub/channel/stumptown`

* Content-type: application/json

```json
{
   "ttlDays": "14",
   "description": "a sequence of all the coffee orders from stumptown",
   "tags": ["coffee"]
}
```

On success:  `HTTP/1.1 201 OK`

```json
{
    "_links": {
        "self": {
            "href": "http://hub/channel/stumptown"
        },
        "latest": {
            "href": "http://hub/channel/stumptown/latest"
        },
        "earliest": {
            "href": "http://hub/channel/stumptown/earliest"
        },
        "bulk": {
             "href": "http://hub/channel/stumptown/bulk"
        },
        "ws": {
            "href": "ws://hub/channel/stumptown/ws"
        },
        "time": {
            "href": "http://hub/channel/stumptown/time"
        },
        "status" : {
              "href" : "http://hub/channel/load_test_1/status"
        }
    },
    "name": "stumptown",
    "creationDate": "2013-04-23T20:25:33.434Z",
    "ttlDays": 14,
    "description": "a sequence of all the coffee orders from stumptown",
    "tags": ["coffee"],
    "replicationSource": ""
}
```

Here's how you can do this with curl:
```bash
curl -i -X PUT http://hub/channel/stumptown

or

curl -i -X PUT --header "Content-type: application/json"  --data '{ "description" : "stumpy", "ttlDays" : 1 }' http://localhost:9080/channel/stumptown
```

## update a channel

Some channel metadata can be updated. The update format looks much like the channel create format
(currently, only `ttlDays`, `description`, `tags`, `owner` and `replicationSource` can be updated).
Each of these fields is optional.

`PUT http://hub/channel/channelname`

## fetch channel metadata

To fetch metadata about a channel, do a GET on its `self` link:

`GET http://hub/channel/stumptown`

On success: `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`  (see example return data from create channel).

Here's how you can do this with curl:

`curl http://hub/channel/stumptown`
